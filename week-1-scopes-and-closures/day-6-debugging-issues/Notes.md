# Debugging JavaScript

## 🔍 What is Debugging?

Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors (bugs) in your code. It’s an essential skill for becoming a better developer.

## 🧠 Understand the Problem First

Before you jump into fixing, make sure you:

- Reproduce the bug consistently.

- Understand what the code is supposed to do.

- Look at recent changes or edge cases.

## 🛠️ Common Debugging Tools

1. console.log()

- A simple but powerful way to inspect values and trace execution.

- Use it to log variables, object structures, function calls.

2. Browser DevTools

- Elements tab: Inspect DOM.

- Console tab: See errors, run JS directly.

- Sources tab: Step through code line by line.

- Network tab: Check API calls and responses.

3. Breakpoints

- Pause your code at a specific line.

- Inspect variables, call stacks, and control flow.

- Step through code with buttons like Step Over, Step Into, and Continue.

4. debugger statement

- Add debugger; directly in your code to trigger a breakpoint.

## 🐞 Types of Errors

- Syntax errors: Code doesn’t run (e.g., missing brackets).

- Runtime errors: Code runs but crashes partway through.

- Logical errors: Code runs, but results are wrong.

## 🧼 Fixing the Bug

- Simplify the code – isolate the bug.

- Check assumptions – log inputs/outputs.

- Read error messages carefully – they often point to the issue.

- Use version control – revert to a previous working state if needed.

## 💡 Tips

- Start small and work incrementally.

- Comment out sections of code to isolate problems.

- Use descriptive names and consistent formatting to avoid confusion.
